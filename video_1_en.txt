How are you?
(Good)
Don't interrupt me too much because we have a clock here
that's ticking and it's ten minutes and if I go over,
ther are snipers everywhere (auf schritt und tritt, at every turn)
They shoot me, they kill me
It wouldn't be cool
So please cooperate with me.
I am Sofia Nino de Rivera
and i am here to speak
about what was hardest for me to learn
when six years ago i decided
to quit my job
sell my car and become a comedian
and what cost me the most work
was learning to have free tiempo
I will explain why
when i was little
i used to play as an adult as all children do
and i played "house"
and i played being a "teacher"
and i played being a "secretary"
and all my games had something in common
which was that I imagined being an adult
but all the time i was in a bad mood
and stressed and in a hurry
Those were my games
Because that's how I thought adult life was
and well... isn't it`?
(laughs)
And then,
when i played "house"
i played as the mother who scolded all the children and punished them,
and the teacher scolded all the students and punished them
and the secretary, well i slept with my boss, right?
and things like that
(laughts)
then i realized,
that we are taught from a very young age
that what matters in your life
is that all the education that you have, and so on
is for you to work when you grow up
earn money, have a family
and sustain yourself
Not to have fun
not about doing anything else
but being an adult, because that's what it's about
And so,
I was in a great hurry to be and adult
and i already wanted to start working
because i saw that my dad left the house super early
came back super tired, slept incredibly
because he had no energy for anyone else
and i wanted to know what it's like to do that
And so, I started working
from the first semester of university
if we don't count my other jobs
which were, well, washing the car
and carrying the bags for my mom
for which they payed me about five pesos
dont have children carry your bags for you please
i grew up my entire childhood with "sweetie, hand it to me"
all the time
dont do it
and so,
i worked as a creative writer, as a copy trainee,
at an advertising agency, well, at several.
copy trainee means:
copy is writing and editing
and trainee is to earn 500 pesos a month
and that no one
pays attention to you for six years right?
basically
So i started working there
and i was very excited because i was already an adult
i didnt have to pretend anymore
i was going to a real office
with real people
with secretaries who did sleep with their bosses
and so...
(laughs)
i already felt amazing
But then it all fell apart
because i realized that my creativity
which was what mattered most to me
when working in advertising
was really curtailed (alibied?, hindered?)
by
a brief that they said to me
you have to think like this and to create like this
and im going to decide wheter your idea is worthwile or not
I worked for brands,
selling them products that i wouldn't buy
with ideas that i wasn't proud of
basically i lived
in a wrong freedom
all the office drones will understand
this type of freedom
when there is a long weekend, for example, you say:
oh! im not going to work on monday
Im free
no you're not!
(laughs)
When they tell you it's going to be vacation time
In other words, basically,
life is telling us all the time,
especially in the life of office workers,
is telling us when to 'relax'
when it is right to be able to 'relax'
when it is right  to go on vacation
when it's not bad to watch tv
can only be on saturday and sunday because during the week
unless it's at night
you cant watch tv at 11 am because what an asshole right?
and yes the truth is, yes
but
(laughs)
i realized, in reality
that i dont have freedom
and i wasnt the owner of my time,
that i lived off the free time i had afterwards.
So there
i decided
to quit my job
sell my car
and become a comedian
Why a comedian?
because for me, comedy
is the best form of communication in the world
that's how its been all my life
the only teachers i recognize
or i remember from school
are the ones who made me laugh
anyone in my life, thos who make me laugth,
thos who  i hook up with, yes everyone are the ones who make me laugh
(laughs)
so comedy is super important for me
and that's why i decided that my life
was going to be speaking to the world
through comedy
in a country where we have the best humor in the world
to start, we laugh at death
which country does taht? crazy fucking mexicans
It's just, it's amazing
So i decided to do that
and the hardest thing for me
was not to
give up everything to do that
It wasn't presenting myself in theaters or bars
where no one was going to see me.
They were going to see something else and i was there in the meantime.
They didn't pay me.
My first comedy payment was,
in a little hat i was putting out,
it was incense, a rubber ball,
and candies.
Which was my fault for doing so in Condesa, dammn hippies.
But that's how it was.
(laughs)
And so
I realized that what cost me the most was not that.
It wasn't suddenly thinking that i had already failed
because every time I got on a stage no one laughed.
It wasn't that.
What cost me the most was having free time.
Because there had been
the people in my life
both from offices and at my home
they had been owners of my time and I didnt
know how to have free time.
I could on a monday
go to the cinema at 1pm
but i didn't do it because i felt guilty
because life told me and society told me
that that should not be done.
You have to go to a job, go to an office,
earn a salary, be somebody in society,
for us to value you and think you are succesful.
An so,
i had to learn to chill out
basically!
really!
I had to learn to enjoy my time.
I had everything very seperated.
I thought that my time
and my work
are completely different things.
What entertained me was different from how i worked.
And on the contrary, comedy is about life.
I had to live to keep writing.
And so i realized that what scared people the most
when i said that i am comedian, the first thing i was asked was
"oh and do you make a living off that?"
That was the first thing that they asked me.
Because money is always a hindrance
But they're not going to ask that to another profession.
You're not going to go to a lawyer: "do you make a living from that?"
because we assume they steal enough right?
(laughs)
You're not going to go to a doctor: "do you make a living from that?"
because they charge us 1500 pesos to tell us "it's stress"
(laughs)
But when it comes to things like that,
they ask if you make a living from it, because people are afraid
not being able to do something they like
and also earn from it.
I'm not going to tell you how much i earn,
i mean, i didnt charge for this, but
I'm not going to tell you how much i earn.
But i earn more in one hour,
that what i used to earn in one month in advertising.
And then i realized,
that what scares people the most...
They would say to me:
But what do you do all day?
and i wanted to lie to them
because i felt guilty that:
"Nothing, i didn't do anything dude, i did nothing".
"i mean, i stayed in my pyjamas, i didn't shower, i did nothing dude"
because people look at you with a face like:
"mhh, no yeah you're not doing well are you? no no no"
(laughs)
But we need to change the concept of doing nothing,
of free time,
The Time is not free or slave.
stop saying you have free time.
We have time.
That's it.
It doesn't have to be free
from the slavery that you live all the time
and now yes, i can do what i like.
We have to learn
to be masters of our own time.
That the office isn't the one to tell you,
that your parents or your partners aren't the ones to tell you.
If companies really
put the same effort,
inside a company
to tell people:
"you have to work and also do recreational things"
the working world would be completely different
I'm not telling you: quit, become comedians,
because most of you wouldn't be funny,
but we could
start having happy people at work
who dont have to go home afterwards to say
Now im going to read
Now im going to do what i like
Then your life is not divided
That it is your full time.
i once went to give a stand up workshop at a company
the most bureaucratic one I've known so far
the people who dedicate themselves to programming.
they dedicate themselves to other super boring things that i never understood
and they were the people
least fun in the world basically
so,
i gave them the stand up workshop
and what caught my attention the most
is that they didn't know each other
but they saw each other every day
They didn't know that there was one who was a widower
who had two daughters,
had to go to school every day,
solve problems like that and work.
They didnt know there was another one who had a teenage son
who made her life impossible, as teenagers do.
They didnt know.
Becausee inside companies
they live like robots.
And i dont want everyone to quit
and become a painter, writer and so on.
Because we need lawyers, doctors and boring people.
We need them.
(laughs)
But we need people like that, happy people.
People like that...
Thanks for trying to start a round of applause
(laughs)
(applause)
We need each one of you
if you are in a company
to be able to tell your boss
or you being bosses:
"It's wednesday,
i'm fed up, i can't think,
i have six meetings waiting for me and i cant
ill be right back
im going to chill out!"
(laughs)
Why are there offices like google
that have hammocks
and have ping pong
Also those at google, dont kid yourselves
they have everything, basically, inside there
(laughs)
Why?
Because they know that people who are happy
and who utilize their time
as recreational and working time
are much more productive
I had never worked so much
until i became a comedian.
i was very lazy, in the agency.
But it's true.
what im getting at is:
we have to learn to chill out
in a productive way
so that it works in favor of our spirit.
Thank you very much.
(applause)
Thank you.
